# Principal Component Analysis
I'll explain the steps involved in PCA with codes without implemeting scikit-learn.In the end we'll see the shortcut(alternative) way to apply PCA using Scikit-learn.The main aim of this tutorial is to explain what actually happens in background when you apply PCA algorithm.

# Detail-analysis-of-Support-Vector-Machine
We are  going to run Support Vector machine with different kernels(linear,gaussian,polynomial) and also tune the various parameters such as C ,gamma and degree to find out the best performing model . We'll go into deep and detail analysis of SVM and see how tuning of the parameters affects the model.

# PCA with scikit learn
Principal component analysis is applied on the given dataset using Scikit-learn and dimensions(also known as components) with maximum variance(where the data is spread out)is found out.Features with little variance in the data are then projected into new lower dimension. Then the models are trained on transformed dataset to apply machine learning models.Random forest Regressor technique was applied on old and the transformed datasets and comparison was done.
